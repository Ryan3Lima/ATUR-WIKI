    "The goal of this workflow is in short to share what we have learned. But also to provide as much context and guidance as possible so this research does not sit on a shelf somewhere. Therefore we are going to create a knowledge repository. However, in order to do that, it will take a little bit of work upfront. You are going to have to spend some time learning some new things. I assure you though the hard work will have a great payoff. \n",
